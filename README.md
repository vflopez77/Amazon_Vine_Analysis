# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview
The Amazon Vine program acquires product reviews from reviewers who receive products from manufacturers in return for their reviews.  This insures that the products are reviewed, providing a benefit for both the manufacturers and Amazon.  The question is whether Vine reviews show a positive bias.  To answer this, we have done a series of analyses of Vine reviews vs. the general review population for a product segment: Mobile Electronics.
